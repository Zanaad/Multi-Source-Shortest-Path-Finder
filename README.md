## How Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Works

The **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** is a dynamic programming approach used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of
nodes in a weighted graph.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Represent the graph with an adjacency matrix `dist[][]`, where `dist[i][j]` contains the weight of the edge
      between node `i` and node `j`.
    - Set `dist[i][j]` to infinity if there is no direct edge between `i` and `j`, and `dist[i][i] = 0` for all nodes.

2. **Iterative Updates**:
    - For each intermediate node `k`, check if a shorter path exists between nodes `i` and `j` via `k`. Update the
      distance matrix as:
      ```plaintext
      dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
      ```

3. **Final Result**:
    - After running through all possible intermediate nodes, `dist[i][j]` contains the shortest path from node `i` to
      node `j`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(V^3), where V is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V^2), as it requires maintaining a distance matrix.

## Vizualization

Before selecting the type of visualization, we first specify the algorithm and the number of vertices, followed by defining the weights for the edges.
